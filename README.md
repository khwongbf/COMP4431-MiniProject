# COMP4431-MiniProject

## To-Do List
- [x] A drop down menu to switch between linear, logarithmic and exponential for each section of the ADSR envelope

- [x] Two text boxes to choose the time between starting/ending point and the envelope

- [ ] A mini graph (next to parameters) to display the ADSR envelope

- [x] A button to choose whether to invert ADSR envelope or not. If selected, the amplitude of the ADSR envelope will be flipped, max => min and min => max. 

- [x] A text box/slider to adjust the time constant of the decay 

- [x] A text box/slider to adjust the base of the exponent or logarithm. 

- [x] A text box / spinner to define the threshold as a percentage of the amplitude to be not silent, where amplitude values <= threshold will become 0 in amplitude.
